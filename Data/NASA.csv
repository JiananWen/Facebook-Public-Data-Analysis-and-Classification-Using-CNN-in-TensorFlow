the ruddy color of jupiter s great red spot is likely a product of simple chemicals being broken apart by sunlight in the planet s upper atmosphere  according to a new analysis of data from nasa s cassini mission the results contradict the other leading theory for the origin of the spot s striking color that the reddish chemicals come from beneath jupiter s clouds researchers arrived at their conclusions using a combination of data from cassini s december 2000 jupiter flyby and laboratory experiments in the lab  the researchers blasted ammonia and acetylene gases chemicals known to exist on jupiter with ultraviolet light  to simulate the sun s effects on these materials at the extreme heights of clouds in the great red spot this produced a reddish material  which the team compared to the great red spot as observed by cassini s visible and infrared mapping spectrometer  vims  they found that the light scattering properties of their red concoction nicely matched a model of the great red spot in which the red colored material is confined to the uppermost reaches of the giant cyclone like feature a coloring agent confined to the top of the clouds would be inconsistent with the competing theory  which posits that the spot s red color is due to upwelling chemicals formed deep beneath the visible cloud layers  he said if red material were being transported from below  it should be present at other altitudes as well  which would make the red spot redder still the great red spot is a long lived feature in jupiter s atmosphere that is as wide as two earths jupiter possesses three main cloud layers  which occupy specific altitudes in its skies from highest to lowest they are ammonia  ammonium hydrosulfide and water clouds image credit nasa jpl caltech space science institute,NASA

moon or planet  the exomoon hunt continues researchers have detected the first exomoon candidate a moon orbiting a planet that lies outside our solar system using a technique called microlensing  they observed what could be either a moon and a planet or a planet and a star this artist s conception depicts the two possibilities  with the planet moon pairing on the left  and star planet on the right if the moon scenario is true  the moon would weigh less than earth  and the planet would be more massive than jupiter the scientists ca nt confirm the results partly because microlensing events happen once  due to chance encounters the events occur when a star or planet happens to pass in front of a more distant star  causing the distant star to brighten if the passing object has a companion either a planet or moon it will alter the brightening effect once the event is over  it is possible to study the passing object on its own but the results would still not be able to distinguish between a planet moon duo and a faint star planet both pairings would be too dim to be seen image credit nasa jpl caltech,NASA

what was the fate of comet ison  scientists are still unsure there is no doubt that the comet shrank in size considerably as it rounded the sun and there s no doubt that something made it out on the other side to shoot back into space the question remains as to whether the bright spot seen moving away from the sun was simply debris  or whether a small nucleus of the original ball of ice was still there regardless  it is likely that it is now only dust by monitoring its changes in brightness over time  scientists can estimate whether there s a nucleus or not  but our best chance at knowing for sure will be if the hubble space telescope makes observations later in december 2013 in this time lapse image  comet ison comes in from the bottom right and moves out toward the upper right  getting fainter and fainter this image is from the esa nasa solar and heliospheric observatory the image of the sun at the center is from nasa s solar dynamics observatory image credit esa nasa soho sdo gsfc nasa space cometison stars astronomy universe solarsystem hubble sdo,NASA

in the summer of 2012  the floating cap of sea ice in the arctic ocean shrunk to the smallest area ever recorded in the satellite era  which begins in the 1970s in fact  the ice cap melted to an extent less than half of what it was at the same time of year in 1979  making it one of the most dramatic and visible signs of climate change arctic sea ice endures an annual shrink and swell cycle as temperatures change with the seasons it typically reaches its smallest extent at the end of the summer but lately scientists including former nasa chief scientist and polar researcher waleed abdalati  now at the university of colorado have begun to talk more about the possibility of the ice cap melting completely in the summer in the coming decades so far  the 2013 melt rate is not matching 2012 but scientists don t expect a consistent year after year loss annual variations in air and ocean temperatures mean that the size of the sea ice cap will fluctuate year to year but will it melt away one of these summers,NASA
